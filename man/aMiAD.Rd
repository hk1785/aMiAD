\title{
Adaptive Microbiome Alpha-diversity-based Association Analysis
}
\description{
This function tests the association between microbial diversity in a community and a host trait of interest with or without covariate adjustments (e.g., age and gender). For the host trait of interest, a continuous (e.g., BMI) or binary (e.g., disease status, treatment/placebo) trait can be handled.
}
\usage{
aMiAD(alpha, Y, cov = NULL, model = c("gaussian", "binomial"), n.perm = 5000)
}
\arguments{
  \item{alpha}{
A matrix for alpha-diversity metrics. Format: rows are samples and columns are alpha-diversity metrics (See ?Alpha.Diversity).
}
  \item{Y}{
A numeric vector for a continuous or a binary trait of interest.
}
  \item{cov}{
A matrix (or vector) for covariate adjustment(s). Format: rows are samples and columns are covariate variables. Default is Null.
}
  \item{model}{
"gaussian" is for a continuous trait and "binomial" is for a binary trait.
}
  \item{n.perm}{
The number of permutations. Default is 5000.
}
}
\value{
$ItembyItem.out - Item-by-item Î±-diversity-based association analyses. 

$aMiAD.out - aMiAD. 'p-value' and 'aMiDivES' are the p-value and microbial diversity effect score estimated by aMiAD.  

* Hypothesis testing - 'p-value < 0.05' indicates that microbial diversity is statistically significantly associated with a host trait.

* Effect estimation - 'aMiDivES' represents the effect direction and size of the microbial diversity on a host trait. 'aMiDivES > 0' and 'aMiDivES < 0'indicate positive and negative associations, respectively (e.g., if a binary trait is coded as 0 for the non-diseased population and 1 for the diseased population and 'aMiDivES < 0', aMiAD estimates that the diseased population has lower microbial diversity than the non-diseased population.
